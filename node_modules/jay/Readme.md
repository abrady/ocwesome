# jay

The hottest frontend wrapper around. Inspired by browserify, jay gives you a browser-side require() for your javascript, css, & templates.

Jay allows you to componentize your frontend, breaking it up into a structure that makes the most sense to you. Jay was originally built for use with express, but may be extended to other http servers.

## Installation

    npm install jay

## Example

**kanye.js**

```js

/**
 * Module dependencies
 */

var $ = require('jquery');

/**
 * Require `Kanye` styling
 */

require('./kanye.css')

/**
 * Export `Kanye`
 */

var Kanye = module.exports = function() { ... };

/**
 * Add a (mustache) template
 */

Kanye.prototype.template = require('./kanye.mu');

/**
 * Render `Kanye` template
 */
 
Kanye.prototype.render = function(locals) {
  document.body.appendChild(this.template(locals));
};
```

**jay.js**
```js
/**
 * Module dependencies
 */

var Kanye = require('./kanye');

/**
 * Export `Jay`
 */

var Jay = module.exports = function() { ... };

/**
 * Play the next song
 */

Jay.prototype.nextSong = function() {
  if(this.isTired()) {
    kanye = new Kanye();
    kanye.render({ sunglasses : 'Ray Ban', chains : true });
  }
}
```

## How it works

Jay attaches to the view engine, so refreshing the view will rebuild the components. The reason for attaching to the view engine is that it's the very first point where we've actually resolved what view will be rendered. Jay assumes that your view has a corresponding javascript file with the same name, so if you're rendering `./index.html`, jay will look for `./index.js`, in that same directory.

Jay then walks through the dependencies of `index.js`, building them, then wrapping them up to serve to the frontend. From there, your static file server is responsible for serving the output files. In express, that's `express.static(...)`.

When jay encounters a stylesheet, it gets removed from the javascript, but added to the `build.css` output.

When jay encounters a template, it will compile the template into a function and serve it with the rest of the javascript.

## Using express

```js
var express = require('express'),
    jay = require('jay'),
    cons = require('consolidate'),
    app = express();

/**
 * Jay Configuration
 */

jay.root(__dirname)
   .build(join(__dirname, 'build'))
   .include('hogan.js', '/vendor/hogan.js');

/**
 * Configuration
 */

app.configure(function() {
  app.set('view engine', 'html');
  app.use(express['static'](join(__dirname, 'build')));
});

app.configure('development', function() {
  // Jay wraps around the templating engine,
  // should only be wrapped during development
  app.engine('html', jay(cons.hogan));
});

app.configure('production', function() {
  app.engine('html', cons.hogan);
});

...

app.listen(8080);
```

## API

### root(dir)

**Required**. The root directory for jay. Absolute paths map to the root, for example `/models/user.js` maps to `$ROOT/models/user.js`

```js
jay.root(__dirname);
```

### build(dir)

Where the build files are outputted. Defaults to `$ROOT/build`.

```js
jay.build(path.join(__dirname, 'out'));
```

### alias(to, from)

Alias an asset that has already been required by the view. Useful for creating shorter, perhaps more familiar routes.

> Note: `from` is relative to `jay`'s root, which may not be the same as the relative path from your server.

```js
jay.alias('jquery', '/vendor/jquery.js')
   .alias('underscore', '/vendor/underscore.js')
```

### include([alias], asset)

Includes an `asset` that is not currently being required by the view.
Useful for adding client-side templating libraries (hogan.js, jade.js) without requiring them explicitly.

If `alias` is used, it will also create an alias to that included `asset`.

> Note: `asset` is relative to `jay`'s root, which may not be the same as the relative path from your server.

```js
jay.include('hogan.js', '/vendor/hogan.js');
```

### cache(dir)

Jay uses `deputy` for caching the require dependency tree. `dir` specifies where the cache is stored. Defaults to `$HOME/.jay/cache.json`.

```js
jay.cache('.jay/app.json')
```

To turn off caching:

```js
jay.cache(false);
```

### jay(function(path, locals, fn))

Jay works with any supported express templating engine. You can even use your own templating language with jay as long as you follow the express engine function signature.

```js
var supersizer = function(path, locals, fn) {
  var str = fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8');
  str = str.replace(/h(\d)/g, function(m, p) {
    p = (p > 1) ? p : 2;
    return 'h' + --p;
  });
  return fn(null, str);
};

app.engine('html', jay(supersizer));
```

### create()

Create a new instance of `jay`.

```js
var jay = require('jay'),
    jay2 = jay.create();
```
